.SH BUGS
rclipsim might have an weird behavior if you use it with applications that do not use UTF-8.
Additionally, incremental buffer reading is not implemented,
which means that if an application is to use that so called "feature",
rclipsim won't save that text to history.
Please report other bugs on codeberg.
